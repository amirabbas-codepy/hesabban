Hello and good time dear users, I wrote a transaction management program so that you can easily manage your daily transactions and understand where your assets are going and, in a way, monitor your income and expenses. This program was written based on a real need that my father had. He always used a notebook to calculate and record his transactions, which made it difficult to calculate, display, and search for transactions. So I designed this program with amazing features in two months.

#Features of this program

Ability to view the dashboard page: View a summary of your financial status and also create a graph of the status of transactions
